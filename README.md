A basic look into the relationship between MLB players max recorded sprint speed and stolen bases accumulated throughout the 2023 season

In this basic statistical analysis, I grabbed data from the 2023 MLB season from baseballsavant.mlb.com with an interest in stolen bases and sprint speed. I first downloaded a csv of the data directly from the website and manipulated the dataframe to get the necessary data. I then plotted the data with pyplot and added a regression line to explore the relationship.

Based on this linear regression, we can see a positive relationship between top sprint speed and total number of stolen bases.
